/*
1) output of cout << "Hello FEs \n Welcome to PICT" << endl;

2) int a = 5; float b = 8.2; char c = '7'
    cout << a + b + c << endl;

o) you are given 3 integers, ask the user for input aqnd print each integer in new line
    Ex. a=3, b=5, c=7
    o/p - 3
          5
          7

3) write a code to swap two numbers i.e. if a = 10 and b = 20, you have to swap the values of a & b so, output will be a = 20 and b = 10

4) you are given scores of n students. so tell if they have passed or failed the examination. if the student scores above 30 then he is considered as passed or else fail
